				<h1>What is the MovieWall?</h1>
				<p>MovieWall is a collection of movie information, but on top of that it is a community network were you can leave an opnion, comment or review of the movies you watch or communicate with other users. We try to catalog every pertinent detail about a movie, from who was in it, to who made it. We then do our best to present this information in a manner that is easy to search and access.</p>
				</div>				
				<div class = "left corner green">
				<p>	MovieWall started as a project by a group of movie fans to express their opinions, essentially something by movie fans for movie fans. And despite our incredible growth, we retain that sensibility. 				</p>
				</div>				
				<div class = "left corner yellow">
				<p>	We are some of our site's most hardcore users. Our managing director claims to have seen over seven thousand movies. One of our proposed slogans is "did you enjoy it" reflecting that we all can express our opinions. we're just a bunch of hardcore movie fans who still can't get over the fact that we're getting paid to keep improving this tool we use so much for our own pleasure.</p>
